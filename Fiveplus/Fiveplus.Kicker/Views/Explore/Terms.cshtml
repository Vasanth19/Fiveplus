    <h3>Handling Orders</h3>

    <ul><li>When a buyer orders a Gig, the seller is notified by email as well as notifications on the site while logged into the account.</li><li>Sellers are required to meet the delivery time they specified when creating their Gigs. Failing to do so will allow the buyer to cancel the order when an order is marked as late and may harm the seller's rating.</li><li>Sellers must send completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Completed Work button (located on the Order page) to mark the order as Delivered.</li><li>Users are responsible for scanning all transferred files for viruses and malware.

However, this will have a negative effect on the seller's rating.</li><li>Buyers may use the "Request Modifications" feature located on the Order page while an order is marked as Delivered if the delivered materials do not match the seller's description on their Gig page or the requirements sent to the seller at the beginning of the order process.</li></ul>

    <h3>Reviews</h3>

    <ul><li>Feedback reviews provided by buyers while completing an order are an essential part of Fiverr's rating system. Reviews demonstrate the buyer's overall experience with the sellers and their service. Buyers are encouraged to communicate to the seller any concerns experienced during their active order in regards to the service provided by the seller.</li><li>Leaving a buyer's feedback is a basic prerogative of a buyer. Feedback reviews will not be removed unless there are clear violations to our Terms of Service.</li><li>To prevent any misuse of our Feedback system, all feedback reviews must come from legitimate sales executed exclusively through the Fiverr platform from users within our Community. Purchases arranged, determined to artificially enhance seller ratings, or to abuse the Fiverr platform with purchases from additional accounts, will result in a permanent suspension of all related accounts.</li><li>Feedback comments given by buyers are publicly displayed on a seller’s Gig page. Buyers have the option not to include a comment, but still rate the service. Cancellation of an order does not remove feedback unless mutually agreed.</li><li>Work Samples are the delivered images and videos sent to a buyer in a delivery message. Work Samples are added to a sellers’ Live Portfolio on their Gig page if the buyer chooses to publish the Work Sample while providing a public feedback review.</li><li>Withholding the delivery of services, files, or information required to complete the Gig’s service with the intent to gain favorable reviews or additional services is prohibited.</li><li>Responding and posting a review: Once work is delivered, the buyer has three days to respond and post a review (or 14 days for Gigs with shipping). If no response is provided within the response period, the order will be considered completed.</li><li>Users are allowed to leave reviews on orders up to 30 days after an order is marked as complete. No new reviews may be added to an order after 30 days.</li></ul>

    <h3>Shipping</h3>

    <ul><li>Some of the services on Fiverr are delivered physically (arts and crafts, collectable items, etc.). For these types of Gigs, sellers may decide to add shipping  charges. Sellers can add shipping charges for local shipping (within the same country) and for international shipping (anywhere else).</li><li>Important: Buyers who order Gigs that require physical delivery, will be asked to provide a shipping address.</li><li>Sellers are responsible for all shipping arrangements once the buyer provides the shipping address.</li><li>Fiverr does not handle or guarantee shipping, tracking, quality, and condition of items or their delivery and shall not be responsible or liable for any damages or other problems resulting from shipping.</li><li>A tracking number is a great way to avoid disputes related to shipping. We require entering the tracking number if available in the order page when delivering your work.</li></ul>

    <h3>Disputes and Cancellations</h3>

    <ul><li>We encourage our buyers and sellers to try and settle conflicts amongst themselves. If for any reason this fails, users can contact Fiverr's Customer Support department for assistance <a href="http://support.fiverr.com">here</a>.</li><li>Order cancellations (when eligible) can be performed by Customer Support only up to a period of 13 days from order completion date. We will not cancel orders after that time.</li><li>Filing a transaction dispute or reversing a payment through your payment provider or your bank is a violation to these Terms of Service. Doing so may get your account temporarily disabled to investigate possible security violations. Note: once you have filed a dispute with your payment provider, the funds will be ineligible for a refund due to our obligations towards the payment provider.</li><li>In the event of a dispute, you are encouraged to use the Site's dispute resolution tools to attempt to resolve the matter by working it out with the seller or if not possible contact customer support for a resolution.</li><li>Eligibility to cancel an order will be assessed by our Customer Support team based on a number of factors, including violations to our Terms of Service, general misconduct, and improper usage of the Fiverr delivery system.</li><li>Orders are not eligible to be cancelled based on the quality of service/materials delivered by the seller if the service was rendered as described in the Gig page. Buyers may rate their experience with the seller on the order page, including the overall level of service quality received.</li><li>Fiverr reserves the right to cancel orders or place funds on hold for any suspected fraudulent transactions made on the Site.</li></ul>

    <h3>Refunds</h3>

    <ul><li>Fiverr does not refund payments made for cancelled orders back to your payment provider. Funds from order cancellations are refunded to the buyer's balance and are available for future purchases on Fiverr.</li><li>Payment refunds, when available from the payment provider, can be performed by our Customer Support team. To prevent fraud and abuse, we limit the total amount of times users can request a payment provider refund from their account which is subject to review by our Customer Support team. Such refunds may be subject to an additional fee.</li></ul>
